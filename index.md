- Lowered Convoy Route Efficiency loss and increased recover speed slightly.
- Subs present in 1936 start get max torpedoes for the 5 Major naval powers.
- Map tweaks in Africa ( Egypt and Ethiopia ).
- Added Operation Countenance for ENG and SOV.
- Added the US navy malus to Philippines to prevent fort building exploit.
- Japan now puppets Siam with their NF.
- Changed MEFO: If the missions runs out after 180 days, it just renews for higher pp cost. If you click the decision to complete the mission, you pay back the mefo bills for CG and PP.
- Updated minelaying and minesweeping missions to be possible to engage.

## 0.10
- Removed mining capabilities and research priorities from Romania to prevent the Black Sea being 100% mined when Barbarossa starts.

- Gave USA back 2 starting techs that were accidentaly removed by failed merge in prior version.
- Added 3 new twin engine Graphics / Names for UK Naval Bombers.
- Updated commonwealth aircraft to match the above.

- Moved USA NF Fund the Navy to below Maritime Commission, locked it behind being at war and added an additional +15% construction speed to dockyards ( 25% total with Maritime Commission ).

- The above National Spirit can be gradually lessened by taking the "Second Vinson Act" and "Two Oceans Navy Act", but not completely removed before USA goes to war. The intention here is to include our house rule that USA can't build forts into the mod in a more dynamic fashion.
- Changed the Japanese NF "Secure the Philippines" to also give a war goal vs USA.

## 0.9
- Fixed back the reduced General command capacity to assignable General traits that was accidentally removed in 0.8
- Skilled staffer can be gained if you have 18 or more divisions in an army instead of 24.
- Gave submarines 5 times as much hitpoints ( to help them survive vs Naval bombers and make the Battle of the Atlantic more of an attritional fight ).
- Gave DD depth charges ~5 times as much sub_attack and limited them to 1 module per DD to promote refitting / using older DDs for ASW duties ( as historical ), make balancing easier, and to make fleet Destroyers with good ASW feasible.
- Increased DD base sub_attack from 1 to 5 ( for same resons as above ).
- Lowered hit chance of depth charges significantly.
- Lowered the time that submarines remain detected for from 20 to 8 hours.

- Reduced the range of all levels of TAC and NAV bombers by 200 km.
- Added a bit of Anti Air to submarines to reduce damage they take from NAV/TAC bombing ( this will result in NAVs getting shot down, not ideal but I think reasonable for balancing ).

- Increased submarines reliability significantly to reduce chance of sinking from NAV/TAC bombing critical hits.

- Added some Army XP to UK NFs ( They only get a total of 15 Army XP in vanilla ), and a few trucks to their tank template.
- Removed about 20 airbase levels in total from Southern and Central UK, if you want to run a large bombing campaign you need to build them up yourself as was done historically!
- Removed all default modules from 1922 and 1936 ships ( no more Battlecruisers with BB armor and lvl 1 engines ).


## 0.8
- Merged in changes from patch 1.7.1 where suitable.
- Added 1 NFs each for JAP/UK/USA for Emergency Convoy Shipbuilding if their free convoys stockpile drop low which gives 3/6/9 dockyards and 100/200/300 extra convoys.
- Lowered how many % of convoys on a route that submarines will generally spot when attacking to be 1/10:th as many ( should normally be around 15-35% of total still )
- Lowered how many regions each convoy raiding taskforce can cover to 1.
- Increased how many convoys each ship can defend with escorting efficiency 100% from 5 to 9 ( This is also increased by doctrines ).
- Doubled submarine chance to be revealed when firing torpedoes from 4% to 8%
- Lowered the maximum penalty to screening from bad positioning from -50% to -30% ( for example if there are more screens than submarines in combat ).
- Lowered submarine visibility reduction from engines from -5% per step to -2% per step.
- Increased submarine visibility for 1936/1940/1944 level by +2/+4/+2 so they are easier to spot.

- Changed Screen to Capital ratio for full screening from 4 to 3 Screens per Capital ship.
- Lowered submarine torpedo module damage from 14/18/23/30 to 6/8/10/12.
- Increased DD strength from 25/40/50/60 to 35/50/65/75 to help make battles less of a screen slaughter.
- Gave UK resource rights for all fuel in Iran/Iraq.
- Increased air fuel consumption by ~15%
- Increased army/land fuel consumption by 40%
- Tweaked fuel so that it's now very slowly lost in green supply when moving or attacking.
- Increased fuel capacity on units to a max of 9 days of full movement consumption and 6.5 days full offensive combat consumption when completely cut off ( about 30% increase ).
- Added a feature that destroys and damages Soviet infrastructure (amount depending on infrastructure level) when they lose control of states to simulate different railway gauges.
