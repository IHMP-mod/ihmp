# Overview of IHMP Features and Changes

## Military

### Goals

- Slow down the war, make attrition more of a factor in war.

### Changes

- Soviet gets a Shock modifier decreasing org and plane combat effecntives when Germany attacks Soviet Union which makes it harder to initially defend.
- Extensive Conscription just gives 4% recruitable population, service by requirement just 7%, and additional conscription level of massive draft was introduced which now gives 10%. Meaning more economic mali earlier if you up conscription law.
- Changed all "recruitable population" modifiers beside conscription laws to "recruitable population ratio", reducing overall manpower for minors quite severly.
- Various traits on generals decrease their comamnd limit, so your perfectly farmed general can in the end maybe just command 12 divisions.
- Template size restricted to 4x3 batallion grid.
- Support companies increased to 6.
- Combat Width matters less by tactics modifing combat width more, being over combat width being less harsh (1.5% instead of 2%) and base front width numbers being weird numbers (90 width +40 for each attack direction) which can't be perfectly filled up for each scenario either way.
- Lowered damage multiplier from attack surpassing DEF/BRK from x4 to x3.
- Paratrooper batallions using half equipment and are half strength compared to regular batallions, just so they use more special forces cap.
- Reduced stat increase from variant system for tanks, to always be under 100% reliabilty for tanks.
- Decreased movement speed for all batallion roughly by 33%.
- Increased local fuel consumption of tank battalions, even in perfect supply tanks lose local fuel and need to stop and refuel after a while of attacks. They stay fully fueled in defensive battles though.
- Equipment reinforcement requests can now take up to 30 days if far away or in bad supply. Capital and good supply = 3 days.
- Reworked weather and terrain attrition. Winter is harsher and there is more reliable mud in Soviet Union.
- Military base production slightly reduced late-war equipment a bit mroe expensive.
- Any form of Batallion level Artillery (Line Arty, Mot. Arty, Self Propelled Arty) has a additional scaling supply state increase.
- Using the More Experience Level for divisions mod functionality.
- Changed Force Atttack and Last Stand Abilities from -100% org damage to -90%, and increased strength damage taken to +90% Also increased their war support reduction effect by +50%.
- Increased minimum training time to 40% instead of 20% and minimum manpower trainable decreased to 30k form 100k, to make expanding your army from a very small size less viable.

## Air

### Goals

- Make the Airwar less devastating and powerful.

### Changes

- Reduced airbase capacity to 100 per level, from 200 per level in vanilla.
- Added scaling airbase level cost, making building high level airbases quite expensive.
- Somewhat reduced the stat differences between the various fighter levels, making fighter I somewhat more viable against fighter II.
- Add meaningful XP modifiers to non-fighter wings.
- Lowered max bonus from outnumbering the enemy in the air from 3:1 to 2:1 planes.
- Lowered Air Superiority base full penalty on DEF/BRK to -40% instead of -50%.
- Lowered Air Superiority base full penalty on speed to -30% instead of -50%.
- Made regular Naval Bombers much more long range, similar to a tactical bomber, but more expensive. For short range you still have CV naval bombers.
- Reduced the range gain by the variant system on high range plane like tactical bombers, strat bombers or (new) naval bombers.
- Transport planes can use the variant system to increase their range.
- Heavy Fighters are more viable by them having more agility and medium aircraft designer giving them even more agility.
- Removed War Support gain/loss from aces.

## Naval

### Goals

- Make mixed fleets more viable, make smaller taskforces more viable, more historcial ships.

### Changes

- Increased position penalty amount by bigger fleet in a naval battle.
- introduced started ship rework from [this thread](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/wrong-and-missing-ships-guide-to-improve-them.1363273/) into the mod.
- Restricted a hull to only have a maximum of 3 Light-Medium Cruiser, 3 Medium, 3 Heavy or 3 Super Heavy Batteries. The rest needs to be filled with secondaries guns, AA or Light Destroyer Guns.
- Changed Hit-Profile of Heavy guns to make them more accurate.
- Made Carriers and capitals have a longer time of free shooting, before the other ships get into range.
- Submarine Torpedo Modules are unlocked by torpedo tech, not submarine tech.
- Removed the increased production cost for "Escort Fleet Designer" and reduced production cost decrease of "Coastal Designer".
- Increased damage variance of shipguns quite a bit.
- Made Ocean and Deep Ocean inviable for mines by removing movement speed penalty and severly reducing hitchance of hitting mines in those naval terrain types.
- All majors start with more dockyards and get more dockyards by their foci. This should allow a more diverse naval production.
- USA starts Isolatinist Navy Spirit, which decreases their dockyard output, naval experience gain and naval doctrine speed dramatically,.
- the spirit can be reduced by Two Ocean Naval Act, which can only be picked by either Japan not paying panay, Germany being in an offensive war or as a fallback it being after 1940 and is removed if USA is in a war.
- Halfed the amount of convoys of everything, and doubled the production cost. Tweaked supply, LL and transport need accordingly. Overall less convoys in battle to escort, but each convoy is more precious.
- When various Allied nations (Poland, Netherlands, Belgium, France) capitulate to Germany, most of their merchant marine, so convoys, go to UK and only a small part to Germany. Less free convoys for Germany, but also stronger UK.
- Added Emergency Convoy Building Program focus to some seafearing major nations, if they are low on convoys, which gives some convoys and decreases convoy consctruction cost considerably.
- Max Shore bombardment is -35% instead of -25%.

## Economical

### Goals

- Reduce snowballing of the various economies, especially for Axis building early Civs.
- Make USA economical stronger.

### Changed

- Increased overall consumer goods need by economic laws (total mob 20%, war eco 25%, partial mob 30%, early mob 35%, civilian 40%).
- Total Mobilisation is restriced to only be pickable after 1941.
- Partial Mobilisation needs atleast 30% War Support, not 25% WS.
- Removed civilian factory construced speed modifier from economic laws.
- Maximum of 10 Civ per construction line assignable.
- Split Synthetic Refiniers into Synthetic Rubber Plant and Synthetic Oil Refinery building types.
- Added Aluminium Facotry building, takes a Shared Factory Slot but gives 4 base aluminium.
- USA and Soviet Union have special decisions to increase building slot limit in their land. The regular decision is also much cheaper and can be selected on map per state.
- German Integrated War Economy also targets Bulgaria, gives even more factories, but in return you can only pick that focus and integrate the econmies if Germany and the Balkan are in a war. Stronger but alter focus.
- Various minor nations, especially in Asia get a form of Agrarian society modifier, which decreases their recrutiable population factor and production output, so nation like Siam, Phillipines, the Middle East or New Zealand don't have to many guns and divisions.
- Made sure that factory spawned by a focus or event only spawn in core territory, and preferably not in territory that is gonna be transfered in the future (Romanian Besserabia e.g.).
- [Allied Construction Projects](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1368202826) is implemented in the mod.

## Technology

### Goals

- Reduce effectivnes researching stuff ahead of time, in return allow more overall diverse research for majors. Nudge to more historical research.

### Changes

- Changed Ahead of time penalty from +200% per year, to +300% per year.
- Changed research year of various tank variants to be later, to not have the Wespe (German LSPART2) for the SCW already.
- Changed some reduced ahead of time penalty effects especially for minors.
- Gave majors an additional research slot at the start, so they have an easier time to research naval techs. (Soviet Union is an exception, but they get an additional research slot from lessons of war focus).
- Retouched Land and Air Doctrines to make the choices more interesting.
- Major nations start with spyplane 1 to make it more viable to use them.
- In air research tree splitted the cv variants from the regular planes, now you can research just cv planes without the need of researching the base model.
- Level 2 Special forces tech gives 2% Special forces limit each.
- Added additional 1940 and 1942 Sonar Tech to inrease sonar more to spot high tech subs.
- Equipment conversion tech now also provides refit speed.
- Concentrated industry has slightly more Max factories in a state modifier (+25% per level, vs +20% of dispersed per level).

## Political

### Goals

- Lots of tweaks to introduce historicy (Continuation war, Economic Benefits of MR Pact) and fix design oversights of Paradox (Influence Spain, Vichy Forming).

### Changes

- Swapping designers after you have picked the initial one is just 100 PP instead of paying the full 150 PP each time again.
- Attache just gives 5% War Support instead of 10% and 5% XP instead of 20% XP, but in return just costs half as much.
- Mongolia and Tannu Tuva start as dominion subjects of Soviet Union. Mostly to make drawing offensive fronts as Japan against Comintern simpler.
- Molotiv Ribbentrop Pact also gives Germany increased trade benefits with Soviet Union, getting 16 ressources per Civ, instead of the regular 8.
- Germany is forced to garrsion Soviet Union with Harsh Occupation, meaning either Forced Labour, Harsh Quotas or Brutal Opression. Meaning Germany needs lots of garrision for Soviet Union making it harsher to push into them.
- Reworked influencing Nationalist Spain as Axis and Allies, one side picks a focus and a timer starts ticking, if the other side doesn't counter the influence intime, Spain is locked into join the respective faction. If both sides did the focus Nationalist Spain stays neutral. .
- Anarchist Spain doesn't rise up as a seperate nation anymore, but instead 10% of republican divisions and stockpile are removed.
- Carlist Spain can in theory still revolt, but AI will always prevent that, since "Consolidate the North" isn't required to pacify the Carlists anymore.
- If Republican Spain win the SCW , they likely will be a puppet of Soviet Union by the vanilla system. They will revolt after 1941, and Soviet can either fight them or let them go free so Rep. Spain can join the Allies.
- Reworked French capitulation.
    - If Paris falls immedatly Germany gets an event which ask if they form Vichy or not. If they want to form Vichy, France will surrender the next day.
- When France capitulated and Vichy forming was selected it immedatly is released, no change for Germany to transfer territory to Italy before. If France capitulates without Paris ever falling then in this moment Germany gets asked if they wanna form Vichy either way.
- Reduced randomness of transfering states to Free France when it does Appeal to Overseas territories. They are guaranteed to get Central Africa, and they have a decision to move their capital there for better supply.
- Italy can ask for Vichy territory up to the Rhone river aslong as any territory still can be claimed with their focus to compensate.
- Allowed various French main foci still to be picked even if France has capitulated. To not block France (with no Vichy) to not be able to pick any foci and/or remove their still existing penalties.
- UK can start the borderwars for Free France against Vichy France, to have more control in player hands (if UK is played but not Free France).
- UK starts with Military Access in Iraq, but if Axis conquers stuff in Africa they'll revolt becoming fascist and revoing Military Access to UK.
- UK gets operations against Iraq and combined operation with Soviet Union against Iran to have war with them and conquer them. For gameplay purpose the operations makes that those nations attack the Allies, so Allies stay in a defensive war.
- UK's focus Indian Autonomy doesn't directly make Raj a Dominion, instead it gives Raj some autonomy points upfront and ticking autonomy over time.
- If Soviet Union annexed Finland instead of just taking border territory in a white peace, Germany can attack Sweden. Otherwise Sweden is not attackable.
- If Germany conquers Norway they can pressure Sweden to give them ressource rights on the Tungsten mine.
- If Finland still exists when Germany and Soviet Union are in a war, they will also attack the Soviet Union, trying to regain their lost territory. They won't join the Axis but give them Miltiary Access.
- Lessons of War Focus for Soviet Union doesn't fully remove the Purge modifier, just decreases the effect considerably.
- Introduced embargo decisions for UK and USA, to embargo Germany/Japan, so they have less access to worldwide ressources (neutral South America for both, or Allied ressources for Japan).
- For USA the Focus Arsenal of Democracy is locked behind 30% War Support, Military Construction behind 35% WS, USACE Projects behind 40% WS and Giant Wakes behind 45% WS. Those foci in return are somewhat bufffed (more factories and Giants Wake directly gives Partial Mob).
- Various War Plans Foci of USA are now 35 days foci.
- To help Japan a bit, the Marco Polo Incident just creates level 3 spirit with -30% attack for Japan, instead -50%. They also just need to escalate the war 3 times to then get fully rid of the spirit.
- Rearanged Canadian and Australian Focus slightly to be able to get rid of their bad modifiers a bit earlier, for more fun.
- Canadia now can do both Steel Car and Zombies, but for a steep cost picking the second focus.
- Bulgaria joins the Axis, but doesn't join the war until they get their promised territories in Macedonia and Thrace.
- Various Fascist South American nations now are neutral instead, so they don't give the Axis Docking Rights.

## Map

- Various Airzone split, especially in North Africa and Soviet Union to make fighting there more intersting.
- Broadend the front in North Africa, El-Alamein is now 2 provinces wide instead of 1.
- Gibraltar has it's own air and seazone, making it easier for the Allies to give air cover and convoy escort, and harder for Axis to gain air superitory there.
- Moved Gibraltar firmly inside the Mediterran.
- Added impassable terrain in the Gobi Desert, reducing the frontwidth of Japan / Mandschukuo against Comintern / Soviet Union.
- Various Ressource Rights added for Allies in Iraq, Iran and Venezuela. Less possible trade for Axis and more Oil especially for UK to use their Navy more effectivly.

## Intel und Spy Operations

- Made Poland, France and China AI build up Passive Defense, making collaberation operations on them more costly.
- Decreased Naval Intel gain from Spynetwork.
- Increased various minimum Intel levels for seeing enemy stuff.
- Stopped the Exploit of tech stealing industry tech by using the loophole of mutually exclusive techs of concentrated and dispersed industry.
- Spy-Defense stacking by multiple operatives on the mission counter-intelligence doesn#t give dimishing returns anymore, but instead each operative gives their full effect (+1 defense normally).

## AI

### Goals

- Make non-played minor less useless, but also stop them interfering with majors (using up supply and airbase space).
- Have Poland, France and China AIs give atleast some resistance against a human player.
- For Majors have a roughy multiplayer-like plan for testing purpose.
- Note: The AI is scripted to work best under the assumption of a historical game, meaning historical factions and start of wars (Germany starts the world war with Danzig or War in roughly 1939). AI isn't well scripted to act dynamically if the players goes fully of the rails.

### Changes

- Restriced minor AI to not build any aircraft to not block airbases with their planes.
- AI is much more willing to give controll of it's division to the faction leader (using requesting foreign troops for created order mechanic, after nation said yes you can remove order and use the divisions as you like).
- Poland tries to build as many divisions with Support AA in them as possible, to delay German light tanks and air dominance. But letting their army be controleld by the faction leader UK, UK also can grind some army XP.
- France researched AT2 guns ahead of time and tries to outfit their army with those to pierce German Medium Tanks. They place divisions on the Belgian border and guard Paris. If UK takes over their divisions and provides air cover they can delay Germany somewhat.
- France also removes their Disjoined Goverment spirit to remove their reduced surrender limit. So if Germany takes Paris and does not form Vichy, they have to conquer all of France.
- France doesn't build any factories in mainland France, they prefer to build factories in Algier (which gets cored by them) and other colonial areas.
- Vichy France after roughly 1 year gives concessions to Germany, like -5% air production cost for Germany, or increased effiency gain speed.
- Free France tries better to get back their lost colonial territory (with factories in them from before) and increase resistance and decrease compliance gain in occupied France.
- If Japan Purges the Kodoha (historical path) China and PRC anticipate the coming war, and band together early.
- China spams as many Infantry with Support AA divisions as they can to slow down Japan.
- The Warlords should guard the naval bases on the coast decently enough.
- Chinas surrenderlimit can't be decreased by collaberation goverment operation, and all of China needs to be conquered before they capitualte.
- All the Warlords become majors if they are in a faction with China and are in a war with Japan, meaning Japan has to conquer everything to get to a peace confereince.
- In return Japan reliable gets compliance on all of China after the peace conference, no wonkyness with the warlords.
- Also Warlords build up infrastructure which helps Japan later for supply in South-East Asia and ressources like Aluminium from Yunnan.
- Mandschukuo annexes Mengoku and gets cores there. They increase infrastructure and rush excavation tech to provide Japan with Aluminium and Oil.
- Siam build up their infrastructure and goes to Free Trade to help Axis with rubber and Japan with supply against Malaysia later. They also build up their airbases.
- Both Siam and Malaysia research Radar Tech, so their overlords Japan and UK can build radar stations in their territory.
- The Spains try to fight their guerillas after the Civil War as fast as possible, saving up Army XP and Inf Equipment for that.
- Tweaked the Spain to follow a given path if influenced by an outside power for nationalist spain, or prepare and start a revolt against the Soviet overlord as Republican Spain.
- If Italiy puppets Ethopia they are more useful, by picking the fascist path for more manpower and industrialising as much as possible.
- Hungary tries to get rid of Trianon as fast as possible and then claim Southern Slovakia so Germany can skip one focus.
- Romania builds up their Oil with Infrastructure, Focus and going to Free Trade.
- Bulgaria industrilies strongly and gets rid of their factions.
- Yugoslavia goes for Pannonian Oil and together with Albania industrializes early to help Italy a bit when they get conquered.
- Greece gets quite a bit of off-map civilian factories by doing Bedrock of Balkan Financal Stability, they use their industry to create a decent army which can delay Italy in the mountains somewhat. Aslong as UK guard their rear with air superioty against Paras and Naval Supremacy against invasions.
- If the borders of Greece are threatend (Albania annexed and Yugoslavia in a war) they try to join the Allies (using a focus), but they won't join the war on their own, unless Italy is already invaded. They still wanna stay outside of the war, but they will allow Allied divisions and planes in their territory if they feel threatend enough.
- Portugal and Norway gurad their ports against sneaky Axis invasions.
- British Raj and the rest of the commonwealth minors have a decent buildup, and they follow UK in picking either dispersed or concentrated industry to share the research bonus.
- For testing stuff in Singleplayer, UK and Italy research Fighter II ahead of time, which can be licensed by faction members, Germany and Soviet research MARM2 ahead of time.
- Soviet Union is stopped from going Service by Requirment with their first PP, they have a decent buildup instead.
- All the AI nations get a free single battalion cavalry battallion, to workaround a bug of Paradox, that AI always take the existing template with the lowest manpower requirment for garrision, which sometimes were tank templates..
- If a nation is AI controlled at gamestart then for many nations their starting cavalary divisions are disbanded (disbanded means they get the manpower and equipment back). The AI works better if they just use 1~2 template types, mostly Infantry.

## Small Tweaks
