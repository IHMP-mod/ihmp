0.9
- Fixed back the reduced General command capacity to assignable General traits that was accidentally removed in 0.8

- Gave submarines 5 times as much hitpoints ( to help them survive vs Naval bombers and make the Battle of the Atlantic more of an attritional fight ).

- Added some Army XP to UK NFs ( They only get a total of 15 Army XP in vanilla ), and a few trucks to their tank template.
- Removed about 20 airbase levels in total from Southern and Central UK, if you want to run a large bombing campaign you need to build them up yourself as was done historically!
- Removed all default modules from 1922 and 1936 ships ( no more Battlecruisers with BB armor and lvl 1 engines ).


0.8
- Merged in changes from patch 1.7.1 where suitable.
- Added 1 NFs each for JAP/UK/USA for Emergency Convoy Shipbuilding if their free convoys stockpile drop low which gives 3/6/9 dockyards and 100/200/300 extra convoys.
- Lowered how many % of convoys on a route that submarines will generally spot when attacking to be 1/10:th as many ( should normally be around 15-35% of total still )
- Lowered how many regions each convoy raiding taskforce can cover to 1.
- Increased how many convoys each ship can defend with escorting efficiency 100% from 5 to 9 ( This is also increased by doctrines ).
- Doubled submarine chance to be revealed when firing torpedoes from 4% to 8%
- Lowered the maximum penalty to screening from bad positioning from -50% to -30% ( for example if there are more screens than submarines in combat ).
- Lowered submarine visibility reduction from engines from -5% per step to -2% per step.
- Increased submarine visibility for 1936/1940/1944 level by +2/+4/+2 so they are easier to spot.

- Changed Screen to Capital ratio for full screening from 4 to 3 Screens per Capital ship.
- Lowered submarine torpedo module damage from 14/18/23/30 to 6/8/10/12.
- Increased DD strength from 25/40/50/60 to 35/50/65/75 to help make battles less of a screen slaughter.
- Gave UK resource rights for all fuel in Iran/Iraq.
- Increased air fuel consumption by ~15%
- Increased army/land fuel consumption by 40%
- Tweaked fuel so that it's now very slowly lost in green supply when moving or attacking.
- Increased fuel capacity on units to a max of 9 days of full movement consumption and 6.5 days full offensive combat consumption when completely cut off ( about 30% increase ).
- Added a feature that destroys and damages Soviet infrastructure (amount depending on infrastructure level) when they lose control of states to simulate different railway gauges.
